        <h3>Here's how Madame Nwanyeruwa ignited the Igbo Women's War:</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Nwanyeruwa was a woman of  the Oloko tribe in Nigeria.</li>
            <br>
            <li>As the typical gender roles of the Igbo culture are reversed as opposed to western culture.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Nwanyeruwa instigated the women's war, also known as
            the Aba Women's riots.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Before the introduction of the new political system
             of governance in igbo land, women had a significant
             role in igbo political life and had very strong
             solidarity groups.</li>
             <br>
            <li>Through women's kinship networks and market network,
             political decision were often boycotted with strikes.</li>
             <br>
            <li>But, it changed in <b>1914</b>, the British decided to put in place a new political system. Causing the igbos to
             be at mercy of the Warrant Chiefs who, over the years,
             became oppressive.</li>
             <br>
            <li>In <b>1925</b>, the British administration conducted a census of all men and their possessions and then placed a tax on them. In order to assist the husbands, the women had the contribute because the taxes were high.</li>
             <br>
            <li>In <b>1929</b>, despite the economic depression in the country rumours began to spread that women would start paying tax.</li>
             <br>
             <li>In mid October,British Captain,John Cook,instructed local warrant chief to re-do their count for taxes.</li>
             <br>
            <li>On <b>November 18,1929</b>, an elderly woman,Nwanyeruwa was approached by a census taker in her Compound in Oloko.</li>
             <br>
            <li>This event was what caused Nwanyeruwa to become the vocal voice of the rebellion against the unfair taxation of the Igbo women, which was against their culture and had never 
             been done before.</li>
             <br>
            <li>Nwanyeruwa ignited the following of other Nigeria women with her challenging of British who attempted to oppress the tribes across the country.</li>
            <br>
            <li>With the event and powerful protests that Nwanyeruwa led she became a very powerful voice as well as serving as a symbol of justice for women all across the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>"Nwanyeruwa life and achievement are testimony to the far contribution that one woman's strong will can bring about
        justice of women all across the world"</b>. <br>
